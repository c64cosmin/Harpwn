Introductions                                                *harpwn*

You have 10 entries to which you can assign a buffer
Limited to 10 because I think that maps well with number on the keyboard

:HarpwnMenu                                                  *harpwnmenu*
	Opens the menu
	You can use the help by pressing ? in the menu
	The menu accepts pressing a number from 0 to 9
	Note that it starts with 1 and ends with 0
	for the convenience (or lack of) the keyboard layout

:HarpwnAdd                                                   *harpwnadd*
	To add the current buffer to the list of entires
	If all 10 entries are full it won't do anything

:HarpwnSet {num}                                             *harpwnset*
	Where {num} is a number from 0 to 9
	This will overwrite the entry

:HarpwnGo {num}                                              *harpwngo*
	To jump to a saved buffer
	If the buffer's window has been closed
	it will look for another window that has the buffer open
	if not found it will open the buffer in a new tab

:HarpwnNext {num}                                            *harpwnnext*
	Going thru the valid entries in the list you can use
	If {num} is 1 it will go to the next entry and cycle from start
	If {num} is -1 it will go to the previous entry and cycle from end

:HarpwnDelete {num}                                          *harpwndelete*
	Will delete the entry at position {num}
